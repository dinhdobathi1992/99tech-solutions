# 99Tech DevOps Challenge

## About me

Hi, I'm **Thi Dinh** — a Senior Platform Engineer with 5+ years in cloud infrastructure and DevOps. I've spent most of my career building and managing Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms on AWS and Azure.

Currently at **GFG Group**, previously SRE at **GFT Group** where I managed 40+ Kubernetes clusters for a digital bank in Singapore, and before that DevOps at **Manabie** and **Dai-ichi Life Vietnam**.

A few things I've done that are relevant to this challenge:
- Migrated CI/CD pipelines across multiple platforms (CircleCI → Harness, legacy → GitHub Actions)
- Deployed Karpenter on EKS clusters, cutting EC2 costs by ~30%
- Managed Helm charts and Terraform for large-scale microservice deployments
- Led incident response with <4h downtime targets

Certified: **CKA**, **CKS**, **AWS SAA-C03**, **Terraform Associate**
